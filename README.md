## Object-Oriented Programming Practice

Nothing much to see here honestly.

After going through a few technical assessment during my job-hunting, I've been grilled on the concept of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming).

Yes, I've learned about this during my bootcamp, but it was never stressed that much and I didn't practice it a lot.

This repo is just a sandbox for me to practice on creating class, method, fields, etc.
